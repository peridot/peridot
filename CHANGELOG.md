# Changelog
This file will contain changes in order of newest first.

Currently changes are unversioned and are just tagged by date until we have a stable release.

## 23/3/2020 Open Source release.
Peridot is now open source on GitHub with a very incomplete and dirty codebase, i tried to clean up as much as possible before pushing but there is still a whole lot left to do but i decided to open source it as early as possible to hopefully attract contributors.

## Local Changelog
This are some changelogs done by date locally before the open source release.

This is new so most previous changes aren't recorded. (The project actually started at 2019)

### 13/3/2020
- Add support for float, hexadecimal, binary and octal numbers in the lexer.
- Fix libuv `setTimeout` bug. (See `src/tests/asynccl.pd`)
