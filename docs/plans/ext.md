# File Extension
Currently Peridot decides to use `.pd` as the file name, it looks a little unusual so this document talks about if we will ever change the extension.

## `.pr`
One of the ideas i have is `.pr` looks a little better than `.pd` but still not quite.

Should also verify that it isn't already taken.

## `.pt`
Yet another one is `.pt` it still doesn't look that good it looks like it's trying to say "point"

## `.p`
Just one letter `.p`? I don't know. Could also be taken.

## Feedback
Heavy user feedback is required to proceed.
