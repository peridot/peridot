# Peridot Standard Library
This folder holds the code for standard library, if you don't know C but know Peridot this might be a good opportunity to contribute.

As of now non of this is functioning, there is no proper module system yet and the language is very incomplete, i just couldn't stop myself from writing some standard library stuff for the future, helps in deciding some language features i guess.
