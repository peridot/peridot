# Language Test Suite
This are the tests for the language, you should run the tests everytime you rebuild from source to ensure everything is fine in your machine, if any tests fails please file an issue immediately so we can investigate.

## The current and the future.
Currently no tests exist because we did not decide yet how to structure the tests and run them.

After tests are made and if we start distributing binaries this tests should be ran via CI.
